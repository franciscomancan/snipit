Steps to create an collection that is manually defined (not schemaless):
* run command './solr create -c computation'
    => this will result in a new collection that contains all necessary files
* immediately after run './solr config -c computation -p 9876 -property update.autoCreateFields -value false'
    => this will turn off the auto-definition of the various fields which will happen by creating documents
* navigate to the schema page in the solr UI (http://localhost:9876/solr/#/computation/schema), add each field individually and define the type
    => this will result in modifications to the 'solr/server/solr/computation/conf/managed-schema' file
* you should now be able to run the client at the collection, assuming it's configured with the 'computation' in its URL

** Messed around with creating a 'copy field' to allow easier search of all fields of a given index but it turns out
this is too expensive for performance, so don't do it (just make the queries more precise)
